***I have queried the CDC Births Data Summary public dataset available in the BigQuery Sanbbox***

***Query to sort in the other direction, returning the top 10 counties with the highest yearly birth counts between 2016-2018***

SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
ORDER BY
  Births
DESC
LIMIT 
  10
  
***Modified the query so that it returns the top 10 counties with the highest birth counts for 2018 only***

SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
WHERE 
  Year = '2018-01-01'
ORDER BY
  Births
DESC
LIMIT 
  10
